## Overview

ASNA Monarch Nomad (Nomad) is the tool in the ASNA Monarch family that translates the the intermediate Nomad language representation of the IBMi application to C#. Nomad takes the migrated application represented in the Nomad intermediate language as a Visual Studio project, and produces a .Net 5.0 project.

This document describes the main components of the final C# programs and projects.

## The Generated Project
The first major step in the ASNA Monarch migration effort produces as end result a Visual Studio solution containing a Nomad project (called the *logic* project) and an ASP.Net 5.0 razor pages C# website. Opening the solution in Visual Studio and building the logic project will run the Nomad language translation tool to generate the C# .Net 5.0 project. Any errors encounterd in the syntax or semantics of the Nomad logic project will prevent Nomad from producing the desired C# project. Those errors need to be fixed in Nomad before a faithful and trustworthy translation to C# can be achieved.

The Nomad language is based on RPG, but with a program structure that makes it suitable for translation to C#.
